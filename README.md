# delay-calculator

## A simple react app to calculate millisecond values for beat divisions by BPM.

This project was inspired by the delay calculator hosted at [nickfever.com](https://nickfever.com/Music/delay-calculator). While Nick's tool gets the job done, the website has been smothered in advertisements and recalculating timings after a tempo change triggers a (very slow) hard-reload of the page.

Planned future work includes:
  - ~~copy value to clipboard on click~~
  - add `<value + n bar(s)>` tables
  - compile into electron app for offline access
